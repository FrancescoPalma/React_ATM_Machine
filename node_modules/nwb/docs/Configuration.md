## Configuration

nwb will look for an `nwb.config.js` file in the current working directory for project-specific configuration.

This file should export either a configuration object or a function which creates a configuration object when called.

If a function is exported:

* it will be called *after* nwb has ensured the appropriate `NODE_ENV` environment variable has been set for the command being run.
* it will be passed an object containing the following properties:
  * `command`: the name of the nwb command currently being executed.
  * `webpack`: nwb's version of the `webpack` module (for use if you need to [add extra Webpack plugins](#) to the generated configuration).

### Configuration Fields

The object exported or returned by your nwb config can use the following fields:

* nwb Configuration
  * [`type`](#type-string-required)
* Babel Configuration
  * [`babel`](#babel-object)
* Webpack Configuration
  * [`webpack`](#webpack-object)
  * [`webpack.loaders`](#loaders-object)
    * [Default loaders](#default-loaders)
    * [Test loaders](#test-loaders)
  * [`webpack.plugins`](#plugins-object)
    * [`plugins.define`](#pluginsdefine-object)
    * [`plugins.install`](#pluginsinstall-object)
  * [`webpack.extra`](#extra-object)
* Karma Configuration
  * [`karma`](#karma-object)
  * [`karma.tests`](#tests-string)
  * [`karma.frameworks`](#frameworks-arraystring--plugin)
  * [`karma.reporters`](#reporters-arraystring--plugin)
  * [`karma.plugins`](#plugins-arrayplugin)
* npm Build Configuration
  * [`build`](#build-object)
  * UMD build config
    * [`build.umd`](#umd-boolean)
    * [`build.global`](#global-string-required-for-umd-build)
    * [`build.externals`](#externals-object-for-umd-build)
    * [`package.json` fields](#packagejson-umd-banner-configuration)
  * [`build.jsNext`](#jsnext-boolean)

#### `type`: `String` (required for generic build commands)

nwb uses this field to determine which type of project it's working with when generic build commands like `build` are used.

It must be one of:

* `'react-app'`
* `'react-component'`
* `'web-app'`
* `'web-module'`

### Babel Configuration

#### `babel`: `Object`

Use this object to provide your own options for Babel (version 5) - [see the Babel 5 options documentation](https://github.com/babel/babel.github.io/blob/862b43db93e48762671267034a50c30c00e433e2/docs/usage/options.md).

e.g. to use `async`/`await` transforms, you will need to configure Babel's `stage` and `optional` settings:

```js
module.exports = {
  babel: {
    stage: 0,
    optional: ['runtime']
  }
}
```

nwb commands are run in the current working directory, so if you need to configure additional Babel plugins, you can just use their names and let Babel import them.

e.g. to install and use the [babel-plugin-react-html-attrs](https://github.com/insin/babel-plugin-react-html-attrs#readme) plugin:

```
npm install babel-plugin-react-html-attrs@1.x
```
```js
module.exports = {
  babel: {
    plugins: ['react-html-attrs']
  }
}
```

If provided, Babel config will also be used to configure the `babel-loader` Webpack loader if there isn't any other configuration specified for it in [`webpack.loaders`](#loaders-object).

### Webpack Configuration

#### `webpack`: `Object`

Webpack configuration must be provided in a `webpack` object.

##### `loaders`: `Object`

Each [Webpack loader](https://webpack.github.io/docs/loaders.html) configured by default has a unique id you can use to customise it.

To customise a loader, add a prop to the `loaders` object matching its id with a configuration object.

Refer to each loader's documentation for configuration options which can be set via `query`.

e.g., to enable [CSS Modules][CSS Modules]:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    loaders: {
      css: {
        query: {
          modules: true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If a loader supports configuration via a top-level webpack configuration property, this can be provided as `config`. This is primarily for loaders which can't be configured via `query` as they have configuration which can't be serialised, such as instances of plugins.

e.g. to use the `nib` plugin with the [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) preprocessor provided by [nwb-stylus](https://github.com/insin/nwb-stylus):

```js
var nib = require('nib')

module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    loaders: {
      stylus: {
        config: {
          use: [nib()]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can also add new properties directly to the top-level Webpack config using [`extra`](#extra-object)

###### Default Loaders

Default loaders and their ids are:

* `babel` - handles `.js` and `.jsx` files with [babel-loader][babel-loader]

  > Default config: `{exclude: /node_modules/}`

* `css-pipeline` - handles your app's own`.css` files by chaining together a number of loaders:

  > Default config: `{exclude: /node_modules/}`

  Chained loaders are:

  * `style` - (only when serving) applies styles using [style-loader][style-loader]
  * `css` - handles URLs, minification and CSS Modules using [css-loader][css-loader]
  * `autoprefixer` - automatically adds vendor prefixes to CSS using [autoprefixer-loader][autoprefixer-loader]

* `vendor-css-pipeline` - handles `.css` files required from `node_modules`, with the same set of chained loaders as `css-pipeline` but with a `vendor-` prefix in their id.

  > Default config: `{include: /node_modules/}`

* `graphics` - handles `.gif` and `.png` files using using [url-loader][url-loader]

  > Default config: `{query: {limit: 10240}}`

* `jpeg` - handles `.jpeg` files using [file-loader][file-loader]

* `fonts` - handles `.otf`, `.svg`, `.ttf`, `.woff` and `.woff2` files using [url-loader][url-loader]

  > Default config: `{query: {limit: 10240}}`

* `eot` - handles `.eot` files using [file-loader][file-loader]

* `json` - handles `.json` files using [json-loader][json-loader]

###### Test loaders

When running Karma tests with coverage enabled, the following loader will be added:

* `isparta` - handles instrumentation of source files for coverage analysis [isparta-loader][isparta-loader]

  > Default config: `{include: path.join(cwd, 'src')}` (where cwd is the directory you ran `nwb test` from).

  You may need to tweak this loader if you're [changing where Karma looks for tests](#tests-string) - e.g. if you're colocating tests in `__tests__` directories, you will want to configure isparta-loader to ignore these:

  ```js
  module.exports = {
    webpack: {
      loaders: {
        isparta: {
          exclude: /__tests__/
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```



##### `plugins`: `Object`

###### `plugins.define`: `Object`

By default, nwb will use Webpack's [`DefinePlugin`](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#defineplugin) to replace all occurances of `process.env.NODE_ENV` with a string containing `NODE_ENV`'s current value.

You can configure a `plugins.define` object to add your own constant values.

e.g. to replace all occurrences of `__VERSION__` with a string containing your app's version from its `package.json`:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    plugins: {
      define: {
        __VERSION__: JSON.stringify(require('./package.json').version)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

###### `plugins.install`: `Object`

Configures [options for `NpmInstallPlugin`](https://github.com/ericclemmons/npm-install-webpack-plugin#usage), which will be used if you pass `--auto-install` flag to `nwb serve`.

The default options used by nwb are:

```js
{
  save: true
}
```

##### `extra`: `Object`

Extra configuration to be merged into the generated Webpack configuration using [webpack-merge](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge#webpack-merge---merge-designed-for-webpack) - see the [Webpack configuration docs](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html) for the available fields.

Note that you *must* use Webpack's own config structure in this object - e.g. to add an extra loader which isn't managed by nwb's own `webpack.loaders` config, you would need to provide a list of loaders at `webpack.extra.module.loaders`.

```js
var path = require('path')

module.exports = function(nwb) {
  return {
    type: 'react-app',
    webpack: {
      extra: {
        // Allow the use of require('images/blah.png') to require from an
        // src/images from anywhere in the the app.
        resolve: {
          alias: {
            'images': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/images')
          }
        },
        // Example of adding an extra plugin which isn't managed by nwb
        plugins: [
          new nwb.webpack.optimize.MinChunkSizePlugin({
            minChunkSize: 1024
          })
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Karma Configuration

Karma defaults to using the Mocha framework and reporter plugins, but it's possible to configure your own, as well as where it looks for tests.

#### `karma`: `Object`

Karma configuration is defined in a `karma` object, using the following fields:

##### `tests`: `String`

By default, Karma will attempt to run tests from `'tests/**/*-test.js'` - you can configure this using the `tests` property.

e.g. if you want to colocate your tests with your source:

```js
module.exports = {
  karma: {
    tests: 'src/**/*-test.js'
  }
}
```

##### `frameworks`: `Array<String | Plugin>`

You must provide the plugin for any custom framework you want to use and manage it as a dependency yourself. Customise the testing framework plugin(s) Karma uses with the `frameworks` and `plugins` props:

```
npm install --save-dev karma-tap
```
```js
module.exports = {
  karma: {
    frameworks: ['tap'],
    plugins: [
      require('karma-tap')
    ]
  }
}
```

nwb can also determine the correct framework name given the plugin itself, so the following is functionally identical to the configuration above:

```js
module.exports = {
  karma: {
    frameworks: [
      require('karma-tap')
    ]
  }
}
```

If a plugin module provides multiple plugins, nwb will only infer the name of the first plugin it provides, so pass it using `plugins` instead and list all the frameworks you want to use, for clarity:

```js
module.exports = {
  karma: {
    frameworks: ['mocha', 'chai', 'chai-as-promised'],
    plugins: [
      require('karma-chai-plugins') // Provides chai, chai-as-promised, ...
    ]
  }
}
```

If you're configuring frameworks and you want to use the Mocha framework managed by nwb, just pass its name as in the above example.

##### `reporters`: `Array<String | Plugin>`

Customising reporters follows the same principle as frameworks, just using the `reporters` prop instead.

For built-in reporters, or nwb's versfon of the Mocha reporter, just pass a name:

```js
module.exports = {
  karma: {
    reporters: ['progress']
  }
}
```

For custom reporters, install and provide the plugin:

```
npm install --save-dev karma-tape-reporter
```
```js
module.exports = {
  karma: {
    reporters: [
      require('karma-tape-reporter')
    ]
  }
}
```

##### `plugins`: `Array<Plugin>`

A list of plugins to be loaded by Karma - this should be used in combination with `frameworks` and `reporters` as necessary.

### npm Build Configuration

#### `build`: `Object`

By default, `nwb build` creates an ES5 build of your React component or vanilla JS module's code for publishing to npm. Additional npm build configuration is defined in a `build` object, using the following fields:

##### `umd`: `Boolean`

Determines whether or not nwb will create a UMD build when you run `nwb build` for a React component or web module.

##### `global`: `String` (*required* for UMD build)

The name of the global variable the UMD build will export.

##### `externals`: `Object` (for UMD build)

A mapping from `peerDependency` module names to the global variables they're expected to be available as for use by the UMD build.

e.g. if you're creating a React component which also depends on [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router), this configuration would ensure they're not included in the UMD build:

```js
module.exports = {
  build: {
    umd: true,
    global: 'MyComponent',
    externals: {
      'react': 'React',
      'react-router': 'ReactRouter'
    }
  }
}
```

#### `package.json` UMD Banner Configuration

A banner comment added to UMD builds will use as many of the following `package.json` fields as are present:

* `name`
* `version`
* `homepage`
* `license`

If all fields are present the banner will be in this format:

```js
/*!
 * nwb 0.6.0 - https://github.com/insin/nwb
 * MIT Licensed
 */
```

##### `jsNext`: `Boolean`

Determines whether or not nwb will create an ES6 modules build for tree-shaking module bundlers when you run `nwb build` for a React component or web module.

```js
module.exports = {
  build: {
    jsNext: true
  }
}
```
