### Contributing

There's still a lot of work to do here! We would love to see you involved! There's lots of useful documentation that can be written and a ton of higher level components are waiting to be built on top of the core ones.

Pull requests are welcome on the develop branch.

We know making you first pull request can be scary. If you have trouble with any of the contribution rules, still make the Pull Request. We are here to help.

We personally think the best way to get started contributing to this library is by using it in one of your projects!
